# Nashville Transit Report
A report outlining the effects of increased bus and train routes in Nashville on traffic flow.


## Nashville has a Traffic Problem

Millions of people work, live, and vacation in the Nashville Metropolitan Area. The growth of the city in regards to its population has out-paced the growth of its infrastructure. There is no clearer image to that fact than in the current status of Nashville's traffic flow (or lack thereof). 

This report takes a look at the current state of our traffic situation, the plans in action by the city to remedy the situation, and my models for how Nashville can improve. This report also collects and compares relevant literature (studies, news articles) about Nashville's transit and urban transit in general. 

The goal of this report is to use data to find an optimal or, at least, preferable solution to the rising concern of traffic. The findings in this report cover the facets of implementation, pricing, time, and approval by the population in regards to possible solutions. There is a range of options from better bus routes, to a fully-integrated light-rail system. The model of data attempts to determine the best approach in that range.
