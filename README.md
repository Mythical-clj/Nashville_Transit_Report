# Nashville_Transit_Report
A report outlining the effects of increased bus and train routes in Nashville on traffic flow.


## Nashville has a Traffic Problem##

Millions of people work, live, and vacation in the Nashville Metropolitan Area. The growth of the city in regards to its population has out-paced the growth of its infrastructure. There is no clearer image to that fact than in the current status of Nashville's traffic flow (or lack thereof). 

This report takes a look at the current state of our traffic situation, the plans in action by the city to remedy the situation, and my models for how Nashville can improve.
